MANILA, Philippines - Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten) remained powerful as it crossed the Ragay Gulf in Bicol as of 2 am on Monday, December 26.

In a bulletin issued 2 am on Monday, state weather bureau PAGASA said Nina is already 55 kilometers west southwest of Pili, Camarines Sur. It continues to move west at 20 kilometers per hour (km/h).
