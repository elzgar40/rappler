At 5 pm on Thursday, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration advised fishermen and others with small sea vessels not to venture out into the seaboards of areas under Signal No. 1, the northern seaboard of Northern Luzon, and the eastern seaboards of the Visayas and Mindanao.

The PCG earlier ordered its units in Northern Luzon and Central Luzon (https://www.rappler.com/nation/211722-philippine-coast-guard-statement-typhoon-mangkhut-september-11-2018) to prepare for Ompong.

PCG Commandant Admiral Elson Hermogino said they must "remind and prevent all types of interisland vessels from sailing" in areas where tropical cyclone warning signals would be raised. - RAPPLER.COM
