MANILA, Philippines - University of the Philippines president Danilo Concepcion questioned the "sudden and uncoordinated intrusion" of uniformed and armed police officers inside the UP Diliman campus who searched for a student for unknown reasons.

In a letter addressed to Philippine National Police chief Oscar Albayalde, Concepcion said the presence of PNP officers raised concerns over the repression of students' rights.

"The UP community is deeply alarmed by this intrusion and the possible reasons for its undertaking," Concepcion said.
What visit? According to witnesses, policemen had been searching for student regent Ivy Joy Taroma on Wednesday, September 12, though they did not disclose the reason for the search.

Photos from social media showed the policemen visited the student's residence and were later on seen in Palma Hall, supposedly to continue the search.

According to Concepcion, UP along with the police and military have had a "longstanding agreement" to coordinate any visits of armed personnel in the campus.

He also noted the university had its own police force to deal with minor incidents and disturbances.

As such, Concepcion asked Albayalde if he or his superintendents were aware of the visit, whether or not they had authorized it, and what the official purpose of it was.

The presence of uniformed officers stoked concerns of human rights violations under Martial Law, where many students were among those abused by government forces.

The incident comes after Concepcion received fierce backlash over his attendance at the Kabataang Barangay reunion, where he was seen alongside Imee Marcos, daughter of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos.

In an apology to the university community, Concepcion vowed to fight all attempts at forgetting Martial Law (https://www.rappler.com/nation/211435-danilo-concepcion-vow-fight-attempts-forget-martial-law). - RAPPLER.COM
